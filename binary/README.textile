# Decompress RettiwT.tgz

When you create Fluid app it happily bundles everything you need togther. I poked around a bit and
noticed that the applications URI is stored in RettiwT.app/Contents/Resources/Config.plist. Since
the URI can be file:// we can build and distribute this just like any other app -- You don't even
have to install Fluid! 

For development I did something a bit sneaky. The URI in Config.plist points to file://Application
which resolves to RettiwT.app/Contents/Resources/Application. In development that is a symlink to
../../../../public/ where the source code lives. In a actual release we would just copy public/ to
Application/. 

* I haven't looked at any style/packaging guides for OSX bundles, I'm not sure having Application 
  in Resources exactly makes sense. I'll have to look more into that.
