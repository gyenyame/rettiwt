** RController has one method:
  initalize() -
    0. Create some Routes 
    1. Routes Connect a RTweet to a a RTweetList
    2. Bind an Event-Handler to a custom Event triggered when Events are 
       Added to a RTweetList
    3. Bind an Event-Handler to the click Event using LIVE
    4. Bind an Event-Handler to the onkeypress Event.

** RTweetRouter has two methods:
  - append() which takes a Name, RTweetList and a Function that will be
    be called for each RTweet passed to RTR's other method, accept().
  - accept() is called with some number of RTweets, it will iterate over
    the RTweets routing each RTweet to some RTL. An RTweet may be routed
    to more than one RTL. 
  
** RTweetList has one method: 
  - add() which takes an array of RTweets that should be added to the 
    this RTL. The RTL maintains a table of previously seen tweets. I
    realize now this is retarded and we only need to store an ID ...
    
    an event: rettiwt.rtweetlist.add is triggred if there > 0 tweets
    are added. 
    
** TwitterPoller has one method:
  - start() which simply starts polling Twitter's /friends_timeline. It
    *should* have error handling, etc. For each Twitter-Tweet, RTweetFactor
    .parse_json() is called, creating an RTweet. Those are passed to RTR
    via accept() which attempts to distribute them.
